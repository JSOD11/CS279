Justin O'Dwyer and Jothi Ramaswamy. This functioning when2meet application was built off of the when2meet clone designed by our classmate Daniel Schwartz (@danielschwartz4) and uses the following library for the calendar functionality: https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-schedule-selector

and you will see a functioning when2meet clone.

# More Details
