# CS 279R HW 0: To-Do App

This To-Do App is adapted from this todo list found on GitHub: https://github.com/IndraMahayana/to-do-List

In order to run this To-Do App, simply open the file index.html using Google Chrome, Safari, or a other similar browser. The functionality includes being able to type todos into the box and hit the check button in order to add them to the list; Here, we will see that we have a few options for dealing with these todos. We can mark a todo as urgent by pressing the exclamation mark button, which will change the text to red so that it will stand out to a user (a feature that I implemented myself). We also have the option to press the check mark button, which will cross out the todo list item, thereby marking it as completed. Finally, we can press the trash can button, allowing us to delete the todo.

This todo list was implemented entirely in HTML, CSS, and JS. The files are heavily commented with explanations of the functionality of each file and chunk of code.
