# Todo App 2

This code is based on the tutorial found at: https://medium.com/@diogo.fg.pinheiro/simple-to-do-list-app-with-node-js-and-mongodb-chapter-1-c645c7a27583

To launch this todo app, clone the repository on your local machine and then change into the directory in terminal. Then type

```
npm start
```

Now type localhost:3000 into your browser of choice. This should show the todo app.

# Usage

The functionality of this Todo App is much greater than the previous iteration. Because data is stored in the cloud using MongoDB, the page can be closed and reopened and todos will remain. Furthermore, users have the ability to edit todos, alongside adding and deleting them.
