### Flask Todo App

This is a simple todo app made using flask and python. The todo app is based off of the todo app contained in this repository: https://github.com/onurtacc/flask-todo-app

#### Usage
Clone the repository and then use your terminal to cd into the directory. We will now create a python3 virtual environment and activate it by running
```
python3 -m venv venv
```
Next, we will run
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
At this point, all that is left to do is run the program. Type
```
python3 app.py
```
into your terminal and hit enter. This should start a local server. Here, a link to a local server should appear somewhere in your terminal, which you should copy and paste into your browser. Now you will see a working todo app.
